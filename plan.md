## About 
About Auracare
Our mission
We’re building AI‑enabled triage tools and smart diagnostics to help pharmacies and GP practices manage minor illnesses safely and fast, freeing up clinicians for complex care.⁠
⁠⁠
⁠​
What we do
Auracare combines an AI triage platform with an easy‑to‑use hardware kit so community clinicians can assess, document, and route patients in minutes — aligned to NICE‑based pathways and tailored to Pharmacy First workflows.⁠
⁠​
Why now
Minor ailments account for a large share of GP appointments. With the NHS expanding Pharmacy First, pharmacies need simple triage, clear documentation, and safe hand‑offs to handle increased demand at scale.⁠
⁠​
How it works
AI triage software
A clinician dashboard guides assessment and suggests care levels, with transparent reasoning and structured notes for referrals or escalation.⁠
⁠​
Integrated hardware
A compact diagnostics kit captures vitals and clinical images directly into the patient record, streamlining documentation and follow‑up.⁠
⁠​
Progress and partnerships
Product stage
Working software demo and in‑development hardware prototype, co‑designed with UK clinicians and pharmacies for workflow fit.⁠
⁠​
Research partners
Collaborating with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhuhai Institute of Advanced Technology) and NHS UCL Hospitals to develop and validate our AI triage system.⁠
⁠​
Impact we’re aiming for
Faster access to care in community settings
Safe, documented triage decisions
Reduced GP backlog by handling common conditions in pharmacies
Better patient experience and outcomes through timely routing⁠
⁠​
Where we operate
We are UK‑led and building toward broader EU deployment. A Hong Kong holding entity supports current operations and future scaling.⁠
